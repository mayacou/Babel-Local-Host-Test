Europarl,sv,"In light of the tendency towards trade globalisation, the unlawful appropriation of designations of origin belonging to high-quality European products and the unfair competition due to cheap labour, this internal and external commitment to promoting agricultural products is particularly pertinent.",,"Mot bakgrund av att handeln blir alltmer globaliserad, att ursprungsbeteckningar som är avsedda för europeiska produkter av hög kvalitet används orättmätigt och att illojal konkurrens uppstår på grund av billig arbetskraft är denna satsning både inom och utanför EU på att främja jordbruksprodukter extra viktig."
